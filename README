1. STFU is an Arduino controlled Visual Indicator for Vehicles.
2. When the STFU button is pressed, it uses a SERVO to raise up a "graphic" element and a set of LED's to light up the "graphic" element for a pre-determined time.
3. One bank of eight LED's can be individually controlled to perform patterns such as running lights.
4. The balance 22 LED's can be controlled as a second block with PWM patterns.
5. A 3 to 8 way multiplexer allows us to control 8 LED's using 3 control pins.
